Write a function roots that computes the roots of a quadratic equation. Check for complex roots and print an
error message saying that the roots are complex.
Hint 1: Your function should take three parameters- what are they?
Hint 2: We know the roots are complex when what condition about the discriminant is met?
Be sure to use a variety of test cases, that include complex roots, real roots, and double roots.
Optional: For an extra challenge, compute and print out the complex roots (Python can natively handle complex
numbers - hereâ€™s a good reference: http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/python/web/complex-type.html).

     if i < 0: 
         res = cmath.sqrt(i)   # cmath.sqrt handles complex numbers
     else:
         res = np.sqrt(i)
     
     p = (-b + res) / (2 * a)
     n = (-b - res) / (2 * a)
